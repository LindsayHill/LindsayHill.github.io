You can find me on Twitter as [northlandboy](https://twitter.com/northlandboy). You can also email me at [lindsay.k.hill@gmail.com](mailto:lindsay.k.hill@gmail.com). GitHub profile is [LindsayHill](https://github.com/LindsayHill).

I am a Network Engineer at AS32590, where I work on all manner of things vaguely-related to networking. Run an eyeballs network, and looking to peer? [Get in touch](https://www.peeringdb.com/asn/32590).

In May 2015, I joined [Brocade](http://www.brocade.com/) as a Product Manager. In October 2017, my Business Unit at Brocade was sold to [Extreme Networks](http://www.extremenetworks.com/). In July 2019 I left Extreme Networks.

Prior to joining Brocade, I worked in a variety of roles, covering network design and architecture, network management, security, and HP-UX/Linux system administration. This covered a range of organisations, from small development shops, to large financial institutions and telecommunications giants.

I am CCIE #36708 (R&S), and hold CISSP, and HP Master ASE certifications. I previously held VCP, RHCE, and most Check Point certifications.

This website covers my technical writing. I also contribute to the following forums and blogs:

  * [Packetpushers.net](http://packetpushers.net) - Home of the Packet Pushers podcast. My articles are at [packetpushers.net/author/lindsay-hill](http://packetpushers.net/author/lindsay-hill/)

  * [CPUG - Check Point User Group](https://www.cpug.org/forums/forum.php) - this one is older than CPshared. I was a very regular poster there, and although I hardly ever post anything now, I'm still the number 2 poster - look at [northlandboy's posts](https://www.cpug.org/forums/members/northlandboy.html?tab=activitystream#activitystream)

  * I used [INE](http://www.ine.com/) materials when studying for CCIE. I found their [online forums](http://ieoc.com/forums) very helpful, and used to [post there regularly](http://ieoc.com/members/northlandboy/activities/default.aspx).

There's probably a few other forums you'll see me pop up on, as either LindsayHill, or northlandboy.

I have also travelled widely - my writings on travel, and less serious topics, are at [www.northlandboyandhisgirl.com](http://www.northlandboyandhisgirl.com).

## Disclaimer {#disclaimer}

This is my general disclaimer, and applies to all my posts. Should I have anything more specific to add in relation to any specific post, I will add it to that post.

I used to work for Brocade, then got acquired by Extreme Networks. I no longer work for Extreme, but I may still be constrained in what I can say about Brocade and/or Extreme. 

I have never been paid for anything I write on this site, nor have I been unduly influenced by any vendor. Of course, this does not mean that vendors have not tried their best to ensure that I see their products in a favourable light! I am grateful for the assistance I have been given, and help in trying to answer my questions.

HP covered my costs to attend HP Discover in 2012 (Las Vegas), 2013 (Las Vegas & Barcelona) and 2017 (Las Vegas). They also gave me a few miscellaneous small items - e.g. an external USB drive, and power pack for charging portable devices.

Juniper gave me an electronic copy of "[Juniper SRX Series](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026785.do)."

The sponsors of Network Field Days [8](http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd8/) and [9](http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd9/) indirectly covered my travel and miscellaneous costs to attend those event. Some of those presenters also gave me some branded items. They do not place any obligation upon to me to write anything, favourable or otherwise.

Some vendors give me early access to software, or they share future roadmaps with me. That may mean that I have access to some information that is not yet in the public domain. I respect that, and in all such instances, I will withhold publication until official announcements are made.

Make sure you do your own research before making major purchasing decisions based upon my opinions. Similarly, do your own research before making changes to production systems based upon something you read here. I do my best, but I make mistakes too.
