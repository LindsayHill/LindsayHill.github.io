This blog is now hosted via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), rather than [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). It is still built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), but I updated the theme to [Mediumish](https://github.com/wowthemesnet/mediumish-theme-jekyll/).

I looked at switching to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) for site generation, but I hit several bugs trying to do the import, and theme setup was a pain. So I stuck with Jekyll, because it's doing what I need. Using Netlify gives me a few more options around build and deploy, and moves away from Cloudflare.

All URLs and [RSS feed](/feed/) should remain the same. [Let me know](mailto:lindsay.k.hill@gmail.com) if you see any issues.
