## What is the "HP Master ASE - Network Infrastructure" certification?


HP has certification tracks covering most of its offerings - Servers, Storage, Software, Blades, Networking, etc. Within each track, there are up to three levels of certification - AIS, ASE and Master ASE. These roughly map to Cisco's CCNA, CCNP and CCIE certification levels. There are three Networking-related tracks - Network Infrastructure, Network Architect, and Wireless Networks Implementer. These approximately map to Cisco's Routing & Switching, Design, and Wireless tracks, respectively.

I've decided to pursue the "[HP Master ASE - Network Infrastructure](http://h10120.www1.hp.com/certification/data_card/HP_MASE_Network_Infrastructure_2011.html)" certification. [According to HP](http://h10120.www1.hp.com/certification/data_card/HP_MASE_Network_Infrastructure_2011.html):


> This certification validates that the technical professional is capable of designing, implementing and troubleshooting enterprise level network solutions, using established core and backbone Layer 2 and Layer 3 technologies such as MPLS and BGP4. This certification also validates that the technical professional can successfully migrate proprietary protocols to open-standard protocols using strategies that reduce risk and downtime.


## Who is it for?

The main target is engineers who work on combined HP/Cisco networks, and have at least 5 years experience. The Master ASE level is aimed at around CCIE level, although with no lab requirement (see below), it will always be considered below [CCIE](http://www.cisco.com/go/ccie)/[JNCIE](http://www.juniper.net/us/en/training/certification/e_track.html#jncieent).

You could maybe argue that the main focus at this stage is HP employees and partners, not direct customers. I don't (yet) see job ads that require HPN certification, nor am I aware of any partner requirements for minimum numbers of certified employees. If HP could get to more like 33% market share, then perhaps we would see a shift towards companies specifically requiring HP certifications.

One of the things they are strong on is interoperability, not just being able to configure & troubleshoot HP equipment. I'm sure they'd like to be able to focus on HP, but they're realistic about modern networks. Most people implementing HPN equipment will either have a Cisco background, or they will be migrating their current network from Cisco to HP. This certification will suit them.


## How do I get it?


HP has tiers of certifications. The lowest level is "AIS - Accredited Integration Specialist." The mid-tier is "ASE - Accredited Systems Engineer." The top level is the "Master ASE - Master Accredited Systems Engineer." Each level has specific exams that must be passed, before being able to move on to the next level. All exams are the typical multi-choice proctor-run exams, held at [Pearson Vue](http://www.pearsonvue.com/) centers worldwide. There are no lab exams.

But if you already hold Cisco certifications, you may be eligible to go through the "Fast Track" program. See this flow diagram:

Since I already hold the CCIE R&S certification, I don't need to go through the lower levels. I can go direct to the highest level. It's also a slightly different set of exams I have to pass. HP's philosophy is "You've already proven you know these technologies - we only need to test you on the specifics of using the technologies on HP equipment."

I need to pass these two exams:


  * [HP0-Y32: Designing and Troubleshooting Open Standard Networks](http://www.certificationexplorer.com/Documents/HP0-Y32.pdf)

  * [HP0-Y37: Migrating and Troubleshooting Enterprise Networks](http://www.certificationexplorer.com/Documents/HP0-Y37.pdf)


Both of these exams are multi-choice exams, around 2-3 hours long.

I also need to submit proof that I have passed CCIE R&S.


## Why am I doing it?


I don't do hands-on network configuration these days. But as I work more with network configuration management tools (rather than just network **monitoring** tools), I need to be able to keep up with element configuration across a variety of vendors and platforms. Several of my customers are in the process of migrating from Cisco to HP network platforms, and I expect this to continue. The price differential in both up-front and support costs for HP vs Cisco is too great to ignore.

Plus I've got all this time on my hands now, post-CCIE. I'm ready for some more study, and a different challenge. The fact that HP gives me credit for my CCIE study is the icing on the cake.

As I work through the exams over the next couple of months I'll post more specific details, along with a review of the exams. Hopefully I'll be able to pass both of these exams within the next three months.


### Resources


I have not found any blogs out there covering achieving this certification. Hopefully my series of posts will go some way to improving the situation.

I have also not been able to find anyone offering rack rental for HP equipment, or any legitimate simulators. There are rumours of a Comware simulator, but there is nothing official. There's not a huge amount of current second-hand HP equipment available either - luckily the price of new kit is not too high.

The only study guides available are official HP press titles. Good thing there's a few familiar authors there - some of them are written by Richard Deal, who wrote the CCNA book I used way back in 2004.
