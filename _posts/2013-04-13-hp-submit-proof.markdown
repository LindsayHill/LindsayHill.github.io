If you currently hold Cisco CCNA, CCNP or CCIE certification, you can use this as credit towards HP AIS, ASE and Master ASE certifications.

You need to submit this:


  1. Your full name, company name, contact information and your HP Learner ID;

  2. Title of the HP certification or service qualification toward which you are applying the credit;

  3. Scanned copy of certificate or exam, showing date of completion.


See [this page](http://www.hp.com/certification/third_party_achievements.html) for more details, and email contact addresses. For some reason, you have to click on a PDF for each region, which then just reiterates the information above, and gives you an email address to use. I cannot understand why they don't just show the email addresses on the page. This is a consistent failing of the HP website, where they repeatedly use PDFs when a simple HTML page would have sufficed.

I submitted my request on a Sunday night, and I got a response within 72 hours. If you go into the Learning Center, you can "Assign" a certification to your account. It then shows you what you need to doÂ to complete the certification. For the HP Master ASE - Network Infrastructure Fast Track path I am following, it now shows that I have completed two of the requirements - CCIE R&S, & HP0-Y32. Now I just need to pass [HP0-Y37](http://www.certificationexplorer.com/Documents/HP0-Y37.pdf), and I will have completed the requirements for HP Master ASE - Network Infrastructure.
