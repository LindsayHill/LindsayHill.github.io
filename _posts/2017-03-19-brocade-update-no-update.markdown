This blog has been quiet since my last post in November 2016, covering the announcement that [Broadcom is acquiring Brocade]({% post_url 2016-11-12-brocadecom %}), and selling off my part of the business. That was over four months ago, and many of you will be wondering what's happening. Unfortunately I have no real news: we still don't know what's happening.

> Update: We now have news: It's [Extreme Networks]({% post_url 2017-04-01-news-at-last-its-extreme %})

Originally we were unsure if the IP business would be sold in whole, or broken into parts. We can now see that it is being broken into parts: Arris is [acquiring the Ruckus Wireless and ICX Switch](http://newsroom.brocade.com/manual-releases/2017/arris-to-acquire-ruckus-wireless-and-icx-switch-bu) business unit. That does not include my part of the business.

Broadcom is continuing to seek buyers for my business unit (Data Center IP, covering [SLX](http://www.brocade.com/en/products-services/routers/slx-9850.html), [MLX](http://www.brocade.com/en/products-services/routers/mlx-series.html) and [VDX](http://www.brocade.com/en/products-services/switches/data-center-switches/vdx-6740-switches.html) product families, and of course [StackStorm](https://stackstorm.com/)). They are also looking for buyers for the Software Business Unit ([vRouter](http://www.brocade.com/en/products-services/software-networking/network-functions-virtualization/vrouter.html), [SDN Controller](http://www.brocade.com/en/products-services/software-networking/sdn-controllers-applications/sdn-controller.html), and [vADC](http://www.brocade.com/en/products-services/software-networking/application-delivery-controllers/virtual-traffic-manager.html)). There are no published timetables for when this process will be complete: it will be done when it's done.

This means that I still don't know what's going to happen to me. My visa is tied to my employer. A change in employer could mean I have to leave the United States. This is making it somewhat tricky to plan for the future. We're all hoping for a resolution soon - I'll be sure to post something here as soon as we know what's happening.
