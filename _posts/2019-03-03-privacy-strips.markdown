I use a [Privacy Filter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BIDDBRC/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) on my laptop screen when traveling. I'm doing a bit of time on planes these days, and it makes a big difference. Most of my code is [Open Source](https://github.com/LindsayHill), but other content is proprietary. High chance of competitors being on the same plane as me, so better to make it harder for others to see.

The only problem with these screens is that if you frequently take it off like I do, the adhesive strips collect dust, and stop sticking after a while. Recently someone asked me how to get them replaced.

3M does not sell replacement strips...but they do something even better: they give them away for free. Pretty cool ah?

Just go [here](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/privacy-screen-protectors-us/resources/attachment-parts/), fill in the details, and they'll send you some more. How good is that?
