I wrote a review of HP's[ Intelligent Management Center](https://.www.hpe.com/networking/imc) (IMC), at [Packetpushers.net](http://packetpushers.net/review-hp-imc-intelligent-management-center/). I like the product, but it was not all glowing:


> IMC has a lot of good features, at what I consider a reasonable price...There’s also a lot of development going on, with multiple significant new features released in the last year. But at times it feels like IMC has just escaped from the lab – some parts are very well documented, other bits are quite unclear. Occasionally it feels like it was an internal-only tool, but the developers have been told to dress it up and publish it. There’s still a few rough edges, and things like the support process don’t seem to be as slick as they should be, for a company with as much software support experience as HP.


I later followed it up with a [review of the 5.1 SP1 update](http://packetpushers.net/hp-imc-5-1-sp1-update/). Interesting changes included Cisco Backups via SSH, KVM support, Display Tiling (big screen views), and Virtual Application Networks. Summary:


> If you’re an existing customer, you should probably upgrade.
