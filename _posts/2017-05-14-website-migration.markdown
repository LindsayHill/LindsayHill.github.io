I have completed migrating my website to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). URLs and [RSS feed](/feed/) location should remain the same. 

The only issue I'm aware of at the moment is with Disqus. I moved my Wordpress comments to Disqus prior to the switchover, but it looks like
the comments are not showing up here. Hopefully will sort that out soon.

[Let me know](mailto:lindsay@lkhill.com) if you see any other issues.
