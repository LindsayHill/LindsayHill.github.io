[HP Discover](https://www.hpe.com/events/discover/) is HP's showcase technology conference, bringing together speakers, presentations, partners and products from right across HP's product line. It covers everything from laptops to servers and software. It's held twice a year, in Las Vegas in June, and in Europe in late November/early December. If you work with HP products or services in any form, it's a great place to find out more about what's happening, what's coming up, and how to make the most out of your systems.

I was lucky enough to go last year, and had a fabulous time, filling my days talking to interesting HP staff, partners and fellow attendees. It was also my first trip to Las Vegas, which was quite unlike any city I'd visited before.

I've just found out that this year I'm going again, but with a twist: I'm going to be speaking. I made a submission to talk about HP's IMC, and it got accepted. One problem: My talk only exists as an abstract - now I need to turn it into a full session. I won't be alone though - [Aaron](http://myteneo.net) will be joining me. The talk will be a fairly low-level technical talk, diving into some very specific bits of implementation, customisation and extension. So content won't be a problem - the challenge will be in whittling it down to fit the time limit, but still impart practical information.

Assuming I'm allowed to, I will later publish the presentation here.

The conference will be held on June 11-13, at the Venetian in Las Vegas. I'm also going to take my wife with me this year - it's a fair way to travel, so we might as well make a little holiday out of it. Hoping to add in a couple of days in San Francisco on the way.
