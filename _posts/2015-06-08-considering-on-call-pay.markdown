Let's say you've been offered a new job. $70k base salary, with up to $20k per year extra for on-call duties. Great! $90k! That's $10k more than my salary now! Sign me up!

Wait a minute. Not so fast.

Years ago I received some good advice: Treat your on-call payment as a separate item. Don't consider it as part of your base salary. This is because you need to be paid properly both for doing your job, **and** for the inconvenience of being on-call.

Evaluate the base salary for what it is: Your salary for doing your day-to-day job. Ignoring the on-call part, did they offer you enough money for the role? Is it a good match for your experience?

Separately decide if the on-call payment is enough to justify being on-call. Does it represent a fair payment for the extra work?

Why does this matter? A few reasons:




    
  * Being on-call has a big impact on your life, and you need to be properly paid for it.

    
  * You still need to get paid properly for the job you do Monday-Friday.

    
  * On-call payments will vary. Your job role could change. Maybe the team gets bigger, and you go on-call less often. Now you're earning less. If your expenditure is based upon maximum on-call payments, you could be in trouble.



Bonus payments are the same. Companies will tempt you with offers of a 20% bonus. Ignore it. Use the base salary for your calculations. A lucky few get 'guaranteed' bonuses. Most of us have some vague rules around when we'll get a bonus, and it usually depends on matters outside our control. You might get it, you might not. You need to base your lifestyle around the money you **know** you're getting, not on the money you **might** be getting.
