It is now almost 12 months since the first announcement that [Broadcom was to acquire Brocade]({% post_url 2016-11-12-brocadecom %}), and sell off the IP parts of the business. It took another 6 months to get confirmation that [Extreme Networks]({% post_url 2017-04-01-news-at-last-its-extreme %}) would be buying my business unit (SRA).

For regulatory reasons, the Broadcom/Brocade transaction has [still not closed](http://newsroom.brocade.com/press-releases/brocade-provides-update-on-proposed-broadcom-acquisition-nasdaq-brcd-1321942#.WfZjvdCnFPY). The original plan was to close that deal first, then close the Extreme transaction. But due to the delays, they re-arranged things, and now the Extreme deal has finally closed. Desks have been cleared, moving crews are working all weekend, and come Monday, I will have a new "Extreme Networks" badge.

What does this mean for me? My group is moving to become part of Extreme Networks. In the short term, I keep working with the same core group of people. But now we will be part of a new wider group, with a different strategic focus.

We will have new systems and applications to integrate StackStorm with, new use-cases, and maybe further opportunities beyond StackStorm. So far all signs are pointing to this being a positive move, and I am looking forward to getting this transition behind us.
