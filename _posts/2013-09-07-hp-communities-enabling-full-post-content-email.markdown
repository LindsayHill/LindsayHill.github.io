The [HP Communities](http://h30499.www3.hp.com/) forums offer email subscriptions for threads you've participated in, or all posts for a specific message board. By default these emails only contain the subject of the post, along with a lot of other text you don't care about. Here's how to make those emails useful, by including the post content:

Go to [http://h30499.www3.hp.com/](http://h30499.www3.hp.com/) and log in. Once you're logged in, click on your "User Settings" in the top right of the screen:

In the expanded menu, click on "My Subscriptions":

[![My Subscriptions](/assets/2013/09/my_subscriptions.jpg)](/assets/2013/09/my_subscriptions.jpg)

Now click on "Options":

[![Subscription Options](/assets/2013/09/hp_options.jpg)](/assets/2013/09/hp_options.jpg)

Here we have to change the "Email Content" radio button - set it to "Subject and body", and Save those settings.

[![Email Content](/assets/2013/09/hp_content.jpg)](/assets/2013/09/hp_content.jpg)

Now any emails notifications you get will have the entire post content, saving you from having to login to view the content. Success!
