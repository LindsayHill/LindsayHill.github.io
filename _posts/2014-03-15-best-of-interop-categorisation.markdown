The "[Best of Interop 2014 Finalists](http://www.informationweek.com/interop/best-of-interop-finalists-announced-for-2014/d/d-id/1127676)" have been announced. Pretty much all the products and technologies that you would expect, but I found the categorisation interesting. As you'd expect, there's an "SDN" category. This year's finalists are:


  * Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) for Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure – Cisco

  * Hydrogen – OpenDaylight Project

  * VMware NSX Network Virtualization Platform – VMware


But then look at the "Networking" section. Finalists are:


  * Avaya – Avaya Fabric Attach

  * Cisco Systems – Cisco ISR 4451-X Converged Branch Infrastructure Solution

  * HP – HP Network Optimizer SDN Application for Microsoft Lync


The first two I expect to see there - a core (but innovative) networking technology, and a new hardware device. But what about HP's SDN/Lync application? Doesn't that belong under the SDN category? I think we're going to see more of this in future - the controller and related parts falls under the SDN category, but the applications will be in a more specific category.

Sign of things to come?
