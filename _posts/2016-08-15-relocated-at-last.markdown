Just a quick note to let you know that I am now based in the San Francisco Bay Area. After much preparation, and administrative hassle, everything is now sorted. My company has relocated me to the Bay Area, where I will work at the San Jose HQ.

Anna has of course joined me. We're living in short-term accommodation in San Francisco right now, and over the next couple of months we'll figure out where we want to stay long-term.

Lots to do, and lots to learn. But I think it will be a good move for me professionally, and I hope that Anna enjoys it too.

If you live in the Bay Area, or you're passing through, I'd love to catch up with you, once we get settled. I'm looking forward to being able to unpack my bags in about a week or so!
