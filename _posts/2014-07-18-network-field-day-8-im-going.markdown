I am lucky enough to be invited to attend [Network Field Day 8](http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd8/) this September, in Silicon Valley. For 3 days, I get to hang out with some of the smartest people in this industry, talking about the latest products and developments in networking. How cool is that?

## What's a Tech Field Day/Network Field Day?


Most of my readers are well aware of how Tech Field Days work, but for those who haven't heard:

> Field Day events bring together innovative IT product vendors and independent thought leaders to share information and opinions in a presentation and discussion format...Our Field Day is an opportunity for tech companies and independent writers to meet, update and discuss products and form new communications.


_[About Tech Field Day](http://techfieldday.com/about/)_

The presentations are heavily technical, and usually involve robust interactions with delegates. All presentations are streamed online, and those watching at home can interact via Twitter. Delegates will be actively following the [#NFD8](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NFD8&src=typd) hashtag, and I know from past experience that questions get quickly picked up.


## Presenters!


As usual, there's a great line-up of companies. [9 companies](http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd8/#Sponsors), talking about their newest stuff. I'm very happy that there will be a wide range of technologies and and products covered. Sometimes international events seem to focus on the very high end of the market, and it's just not applicable to smaller markets like mine. But companies like [A10 Networks](http://www.a10networks.com) and [ThousandEyes](http://www.thousandeyes.com) have products that my customers either are using, or should be using.


## People!


More importantly than companies, there's going to be a lot of great people there. I'm going to meet some [Tweeps](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Tweeps) in Real Life - some I've known online for years now, but never met. That's probably what I'm looking forward to the most.

I'll be arriving in San Francisco on Sunday beforehand, and I don't fly out until late on Saturday evening. Network Field Day is Wednesday -> Friday, so I've got a couple of extra days in the area. If you're in the Bay Area, and want to catch up for coffee/beer, [get in touch](mailto:lindsay@lkhill.com)!
