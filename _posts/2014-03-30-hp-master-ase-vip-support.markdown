HP has announced that HP Master ASE holders can now get [VIP support](http://h10120.www1.hp.com/expertone/documents/Master_ASE_support_hotline_FAQ.pdf). This is supposed to give me:

* Personalized 24/7 hotline for all Master ASE certified engineers, with preferential access to an experienced HP engineer upon validation
* Exclusive, enhanced access to HP networking senior product and solutions engineers from HP support teams and product centers of excellence geared to better assist you with complex networking issues
* 24 x7 preferential break/fix support response
* Hotline number and PIN that identifies you as an HP ExpertOne Master ASE. Using this line and PIN prioritizes and routes your call quickly to experienced engineers, speeding the time to resolve your support needs for your customer or employer

You still have to have a service contract, and it's only for my certification area.

This is broadly similar to the [automatic case routing](http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/certifications/expert/program/index.html) to more experienced engineers that CCIEs get. There is some discussion about [whether this actually happens](http://etherealmind.com/do-cisco-certified-internet-engineers-ccie-get-special-privileges-from-cisco/) (read the comments).

It sounds like a good idea. It will be interesting to see how it goes - I'll try it next time I need to log an IMC case.

In the interests of full disclosure, I should also add that HP recently sent me this bag & framed certificate for completing HP Master ASE - I'm not sure why it was sent nearly a year after I passed the last exam:
