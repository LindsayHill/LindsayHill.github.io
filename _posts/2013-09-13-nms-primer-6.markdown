We've covered [what an NMS does]({% post_url 2013-09-08-nms-primer-1 %}), [selecting an NMS,]({% post_url 2013-09-10-nms-primer-3 %}) and some [tips on implementing]({% post_url 2013-09-12-nms-primer-5 %}) an NMS. But how do we keep an NMS up-to-date and relevant?


## Signs of a well-maintained NMS:


  * Most Operations Engineers have the console up at their desktop. It’s just part of the routine to look at it each morning.

  * When people report network issues, the first place the network engineers look is the NMS. It’s frequently used to prove that no, it’s not the network’s fault.

  * You check the NMS both before and after planned work, to check that everything is behaving as expected.

  * There’s a handful of alarms, and they’ve all been acknowledged, with a note added.

  * There’s more than one person that knows how to drive it


## Signs of an NMS that’s losing the battle:


  * No-one uses the system, except perhaps on a big screen that’s only there because the boss wanted something to look at. When there is a fault, people start logging into routers first.

  * There’s a long list of alarms, including “Node Down” alarms for sites that have been decommissioned.

  * The person who installed it has left, and no-one else really knows how to manage it.


If your NMS regularly displays a long list of alarms like this, something's going wrong:

## No More Shelfware!


How can we ensure that our NMS is like the first one, and doesn’t become shelfware? Several things have to happen - some of them are straightforward technical maintenance, but the more important issues are cultural: NMS management needs to become core to your network management. It’s not an adjunct, a side thing done by the junior - it needs to be something that everyone does. Any network changes should include updates to the NMS.


## What You Must Do


  * Assign responsibility: You may choose to use external resources for some elements of maintenance, but you need an internal person who is responsible.

  * Keep the NMS platform itself up to date. You must stay on top of your patching. The NMS can’t magically know about all new devices that get released - you need to keep it up to date. Plan on patching the application at least every 6 months. Don’t let it get more than one patch cycle behind.

  * Auto-discovery helps with maintaining your inventory, but you should still verify that all new devices show up in your system. Most networks don’t have a high rate of device change - it’s not that hard to check that new devices show up, and old ones are removed. Auto-discovery only works if your templates are up to date, and allow SNMP.

  * Look at it every day, and take action on all alarms. Never simply acknowledge an alarm without knowing why it occurred. Change the threshold, or suppress the alert - preferably at the source, or within the NMS if you must. If you’re repeatedly acknowledging the same alarm, you’re doing it wrong - and heading towards insanity.


{% include warning.html content="Keep your NMS up to date by doing the basics well, on a regular basis, and it will return the investment ten times over. Ignore the regular maintenance, and it will end up like the bike in your shed: Once shiny, but now a sullenly rusting reminder of those grand dreams you once harboured of “getting fit.”" %}

Next up, we'll take a look at how to take your NMS beyond the basics, giving you ideas on extending it to become a truly valuable platform.
