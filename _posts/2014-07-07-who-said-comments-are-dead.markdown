We don't see as many comments on blog posts these days, as most discussion has moved to other forums, such as Twitter or Google+. But this doesn't mean that comments are completely dead.

In his [book on Technical Blogging](https://leanpub.com/Technical-Blogging-Writing-Arse-First), [Greg Ferro](http://etherealmind.com/) says that comment volumes have dropped over the last few years:

> Five years ago I loved the comments from the readers who could point out my mistakes (which I would fix) and discuss ideas and ask questions. Today I get very few comments as most people who might have left comments have moved to Twitter.

Robert Scoble is more forthright, [declaring comments dead](http://scobleizer.com/blog-comments-are-dead-discuss/).

I agree that we see fewer serious comments on blogs now. But this doesn't mean that comments are dead - take a look at the comments on "[Twitter tweet slugfest: Cisco ACI vs. Arista Networks](http://bradreese.com/blog/6-23-2014.htm)." It's up to 90 comments so far, with posts ranging from [IETF processes](http://bradreese.com/blog/6-23-2014.htm#comment-1456351514), [Power supply efficiency](http://bradreese.com/blog/6-23-2014.htm#comment-1457934844), [Arista EOS internals](http://bradreese.com/blog/6-23-2014.htm#comment-1457934844), and of course [far more detail about specific linecards](http://bradreese.com/blog/6-23-2014.htm#comment-1457934844) and testing methodologies than you really wanted to know.

My personal favourite might be the post on [estimating total theoretical possible](http://bradreese.com/blog/6-23-2014.htm#comment-1456130942) data center power draw based on a maximum 150m allowed by OM4 MMF 100Gb cabling. (TL;DR: About 75MW).

It's worth taking the time to read through the comments. Just try to ignore some of the personal attacks, which thankfully seem to settle down after a while.
